Highlight.js\nExample :import { ApplicationConfig } from '@angular/core'\nimport { provideHighlightOptions } from 'nxt-highlightjs'\n\nexport const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {\n    providers: [\n        provideHighlightOptions({\n            fullLibraryLoader: () => import('highlight.js')\n        })\n    ]\n}Above code loads the entire Highlight.js library. To improve performance you might want to load only the core library and neccesary languages.\nExample :import { ApplicationConfig } from '@angular/core'\nimport { provideHighlightOptions } from 'nxt-highlightjs'\n\nexport const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {\n    providers: [\n        provideHighlightOptions({\n            coreLibraryLoader: () => import('highlight.js/lib/core'),\n            lineNumbersLoader: () => import('nxt-highlightjs/line-numbers'), // Optional, add line numbers if needed\n            languages: {\n                typescript: () => import('highlight.js/lib/languages/typescript'),\n                css: () => import('highlight.js/lib/languages/css'),\n                xml: () => import('highlight.js/lib/languages/xml')\n            },\n            themePath: 'path-to-theme.css' // Optional, useful for dynamic theme changes\n        })\n    ]\n}Use it in a template\nExample :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
