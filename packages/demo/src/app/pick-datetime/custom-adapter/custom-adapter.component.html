    <h1>Writing custom date adapter</h1>
    <p>If neither of the provided date adapters is suitable for your project, you it't possible to create your own date-time implementation. Making the picker work with a different date & time implementation is as easy as extending <code>DateTimeAdapter</code>. You will also want to provide a matching <code>NXT_DATE_TIME_FORMATS</code> to configure formatting strings for your implementation.</p>
