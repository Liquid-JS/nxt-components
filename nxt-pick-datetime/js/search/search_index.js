MomentDateTimeModuleImport main module and DateTime adapter provider\nThe date & time picker was built to be date implementation agnostic. It comes with two modules providing date adapter implementation, or you can provide your own adapter by implementing DateTimeAdapter (see documentation).\n\nNativeDateTimeModule - support for native JavaScript Date object\nMomentDateTimeModule - support for MomentJs\n\nimport { DateTimeModule } from 'nxt-pick-datetime'\nimport { NativeDateTimeModule } from 'nxt-pick-datetime/native-adapter'\n\n@NgModule({\n    ...\n    imports: [\n        ...\n        DateTimeModule,\n        NativeDateTimeModule\n    ]\n})Use it in a template\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
